1.//clear deltes all the things int the class
Vector::clear(){
    delete[] pData;
    pData=NULL;
    elementNum =0;
}

2.He puts the global operatros inside private members

3.Dont forget that elementNum was unsigned int

4. You need to check that elementNum is not 0. If it si 
pData should point to NULL;

5. It knows that it can only call the const function
const Vector& Vector::operator[](unsigned int position) const{
    return at(position);
}

6. Don't delete the null pointer;

7.input output is const but the vector with the fucntion is changing
const Vector& Vector::operator=(const Vector& theOther)

8.Be careful with elementNum+1 or position index.
