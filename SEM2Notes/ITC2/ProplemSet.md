$G=(A,B,E)$.
if $|A|\leq|B|$ then we remove all the vertices from $|A|$. All vertices of B become isolated.
$|A|=|X|\leq comp(G-x) =|B|~~~~~H_c::|B|=com(G-x)\leq |x|=|A|\implies |A|=|B|$
So $|A|=50=|B|$. You can have many isomorphism by exchanging the vertices between A and B. But only 1 non-isomorphic such graph.

G(V,E):
- vertices := people.
-  edges := if people know each other.

$\forall v\in G~~\deg(v)\geq n/2 = 6\implies H_c$

Using Hamiltonian cycle to prove Hamiltonian path

We get a g prime which i bigger and that contains a Hamiltonial cycle

Tricks:
Using Hamiltonian cycle to prove Hamiltonian path (add edge)
We get a g prime which is bigger and that contains a Hamiltonial cycle
Add vertices.
Look at the complement if it has graph G.
Nights bipartition the graph (black and white squares)

## Problem set 05
- at most 9 adjacency or at least 7 you just look as an interval.
for $100<xy<400$ when the separate it into d <-10---20 ->
so the squares. 10-20 form a clique.
- Primes usually independent or adjacent to each other.
- If you have |v|=k+2 (simple) k-regular when you have $K_{k+2}-M$
- Usually you just need to look at the independent sets.
