How does the Hamiltonian path corelate with Ore's Theorem and deg(vertex).
We only learnt for Hamiltonian Cycle. 
6) c)
9) b)
10) Lets assume everybody knows 2 people in such a way that they form $C_{20}$
No we seat them as the cycle around the table:
1. Everybody knows his/her neighbors
Now we exchange 2 of them:
2. Second condition doesn't hold.
